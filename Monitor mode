to enter into the monitor mode we use airmon-ng package. Monitor mode allows your device to passively listen to all wireless traffic in the air. It does not actively transmit or participate in communication like when it's in managed mode.
In monitor mode, your device doesn't change or hide its MAC address unless you deliberately spoof it.
STEPS TO ENTER MONITOR MODE - 

>> ifconfig wlan0 down 
>> airmon-ng check kill 
>> iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
>> ifconfig wlan0 up 


in ifconfig wlan0 down it will turn down the interface wlan0 which is the wireless adapter 
it just disables the wireless network of wlan0 
airmon-ng is a part of aircrack-ng package and the cmd airmon-ng check kill will kill all the processes which might stop the 
interface into entering monitor mode 
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor will enter the wireless adapter into the monitor mode 
ifconfig wlan0 up will enable back the wireless adapter
the monitor mode is mostly used to passively listen to network traffic after we have turned on the monitor 
mode we will use airodump-ng to capture all the wireless packets in our network. 
Note- after we turn on the monitor mode our interface is called as mon0 instead of wlan0
for wireless network adapter to listen to more that 5 gigahz - 

>>airodump-ng --band a mon0 

to capture both 2.5ghz and 5ghz frequencies we use this - 

>>airodump-ng --band abg mon0 

for targetted packet sniffing means to know more data about a single network then we use this command -

>>airodump-ng --bssid F8:23:B2:B9:50:AB --channel 2 test mon0

here test is the file in which all the packet sniffed data will be present and it will be a cap file.
wireshark is the tool which is used to analyze the data present in network traffic
