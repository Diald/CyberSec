to enter into the monitor mode we use airmon-ng package. Monitor mode allows your device to passively listen to all wireless traffic in the air. It does not actively transmit or participate in communication like when it's in managed mode.
In monitor mode, your device doesn't change or hide its MAC address unless you deliberately spoof it.
STEPS TO ENTER MONITOR MODE - 

ifconfig wlan0 down 
airmon-ng check kill 
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
ifconfig wlan0 up 


in ifconfig wlan0 down it will turn down the interface wlan0 which is the wireless adapter 
it just disables the wireless network of wlan0 
airmon-ng is a part of aircrack-ng package and the cmd airmon-ng check kill will kill all the processes which might stop the 
interface into entering monitor mode 
iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor will enter the wireless adapter into the monitor mode 
ifconfig wlan0 up will enable back the wireless adapter
